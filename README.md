# EnergyBar-in-Python

A simple Python project to simulate, calculate or manage energy bar usage or energy-bar style calculations.  
Useful for demonstrating logic in Python — such as reading inputs, computing energy/stamina/consumption, or tracking “energy bar” values for games, simulations, or utilities.

## 🎯 Purpose & Features

- Accepts user input or predefined data (e.g. energy bar value, consumption, recharge rates).  
- Calculates resulting energy bar values after operations (e.g. consumption, recharge, time-based depletion).  
- Easy to extend: you can adapt it for different use-cases — games, simulation prototypes, resource tracking, etc.  
- Straightforward, minimal dependencies, ideal for learning and showcasing Python scripting.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3** — main scripting language  
- Pure-Python code by default (no external dependencies required)  
- Optionally you can use standard libraries such as `datetime`, `sys`, or `argparse` if you handle time-based logic or command-line arguments
